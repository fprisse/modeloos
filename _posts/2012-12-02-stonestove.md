The stonestove by Dick van Hoff is a mini version of the swedish clay and tiles that I have seen and admired when living in sweden. These ovens are able to heat a whole house with just 4 logs a day. I am not sure if this mini version works as well but it certainly looks sturdy enough. Produced by ”Weltevree”: the production and retail firm that Floris Schoonderbeek and Dick van Hoff have set up to make their work available to the masses.
