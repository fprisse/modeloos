Somehow through time the U9-3 series cabrio  managed to shake off  its “coke snorting real estate agent” image . Truth is, it always was a beautyfull car to begin with, it was the just wrong people in the late  eighties that drove around in them. It is simply a sexy car, best driven by yummy mummies.

Go for the 6 cilinder 320’s make sure to get the original “crown-cork” rims with it
