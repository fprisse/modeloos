Renowned chef David Thompson first went to Thailand by mistake: a  holiday plan had to be changed at the last minute and he ended up in  Bangkok, where he was seduced by the people, their culture and cuisine.  Since that fateful trip some 20 years ago, Thailand has become his  second home.

Working alongside cooks who had perfected their craft in the Thai  royal palaces, he began to document the traditional recipes and culinary techniques that have been handed down from generation to generation –  before they were eroded, altered and modernized beyond all recognition.  The result is “Thai food”, the most comprehensive account of this  ancient and exotic cuisine ever published in English.
