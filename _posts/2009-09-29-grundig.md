Excellent product, Grundig brings this car-radio with good quality  sound and an auxiliary input jack at the front, no cd, no frills, you  can plugin your sound producing gadget. I t has a great 4x 45 watt  amplifier and . . . . Buttons that do what they say they do !

no longer in production, [this one](?action=view&url=blaupunktdoha) is.
